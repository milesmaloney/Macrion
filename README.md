# Macrion


# Macrion is a Macro-based app that will allow you to create macros using your keyboard and use them whenever you'd like.
# Macrion has functionality for everything you might want to do with these macros and plans to include any mouse/keyboard input within its macros, but currently includes only keyboard functionality.
# This project is currently a WIP. Some bugs are expected and are consistently being worked on alongside the addition of features.
# Macrion was done as a project to further my experience in Python and UI development.
